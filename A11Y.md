In the Login and Register page, added forHtml for every form label, and aria-label and aria-required for input and button. For example the button the go to login from register page is aria-labeled as "Navigate to login page"

Added aria label to most button with ${game.id} in dashboard so it is clear  which game is the operation on. For example, the div for every game it is labelled as `Open game ${game.gameName} edit page` so people can easily tell it which game it is to.

In the PlaySessionPage we set the video to aria-hidden to hides it from screen readers

semantic HTML like button is used to help accessibility and user interaction

Background of div is chosen so it is easy see the text in it.
